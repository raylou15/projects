        <p class="note">
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of Ray’s Games and any games,
          web pages, and Discord Activities hosted on this domain (the “Services”). By using
          the Services, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            You must be able to legally use the Services in your jurisdiction. If you are
            under the minimum age required by law, you may not use the Services.
          </p>

          <p>You agree not to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>cheat, exploit, automate gameplay, or intentionally abuse game mechanics;</li>
            <li>spam, harass, threaten, or encourage harm against others;</li>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Accounts and Discord Integration</h2>
          <p>
            Some Services integrate with Discord. When you play through Discord, Discord may
            provide basic identity information (such as user ID/username/avatar) so the game
            can show your player identity and group rooms. Your use of Discord is governed by
            Discord’s own terms and policies.
          </p>

            suspend, or terminate access for violations of these Terms, cheating, abuse, or
            security threats. Enforcement may include temporary or permanent limitations.
