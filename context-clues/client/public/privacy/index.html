        <p class="note">
          This Privacy Policy explains how Ray’s Games (“we”, “us”) collects, uses, and
          protects information when you play our web games and Discord Activities hosted on
          this domain (the “Services”).
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We collect only what we need to operate the Services, provide gameplay features,
            and keep the Services reliable.
          </p>

          <h3>a) Account and session identifiers</h3>
          <p>
            When you play through Discord, we may receive basic Discord account information
            needed to identify you in the game, such as your Discord user ID, username, and
            avatar. We may also store a session or instance identifier to group players in
            the same game room.
          </p>

          <h3>b) Gameplay data</h3>
          <p>
            We may store gameplay inputs and results such as guesses, scores, ranks, wins,
            streaks, and similar game statistics. These may be tied to your Discord user ID
            and the room/session you played in.
          </p>

          <h3>c) Technical and diagnostic data</h3>
          <p>
            We may collect basic logs and diagnostics such as timestamps, error messages,
            performance metrics, and connection events (e.g., WebSocket connect/disconnect).
            This helps us troubleshoot issues and prevent abuse.
          </p>

          <h3>d) Cookies and local storage</h3>
          <p>
            The Services may use local storage in your browser to save preferences like
            theme (light/dark) and audio settings. These settings are stored on your device.
          </p>
